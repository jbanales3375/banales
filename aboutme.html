     <h1>About me!</h1>
    <br>
  Hi my name is James Banales and I am a senior at Lancaster High School. I am 17 years old and will turn 18 in March. I have gone to LnHs for all 4 years and I am very excited to graduate high school. After I graduate high school I am hoping to attend the University of Southern California. It has always been my dream school and I have been working hard to improve my resume to hopefully attend there fall of 2018.
